			<h4><a>Instructor - Aline Marie</a></h4>
			<p>Aline Marie has been a yoga instructor for nine years, she trained at the esteemed Kripalu Yoga Institute of Lennox Massachusetts.  She has taught throughout the US and focuses on the training of athletes such as body builders, free divers, and athletic sports teams. She is also a certified Thai Yoga Therapist. Consciously taught by Kristina Eberle, M.T., and Dr.Richard Gold, (one of the founding professors) at The International Professional School of Bodywork in San Diego, California. Alines dedication to improving athletic performance, visualization, injury recovery and strength building places her among the very best in in her field.</p>
		</div>
        <div class="span6">
			<p>This program is specifically related to sports training and is broken down into both the physical and mental side of athletics.</p>
			<p>Physically this program works on combining the athletes inner and outer strength and flexibility. The organs, muscles, ligaments, & nerves become energized, purified, toned, & strengthened.  The circulation of blood, oxygen and lymph is also improved.</p>
			<p>On a mental level one develops an awareness of the inner innate intelligence orchestrating the body into each pose. You will begin to see what we normally call intelligence is just a small part of a larger intelligence at work. When one does yoga they enter a mind-set of feeling good; it is out of this good feeling place-space-vortex that one is able to create more good things like visualizing making a putt or completing a crucial pass. When we fall into a negative mind set we lose focus and struggle to overcome our negative way of thinking. Yoga helps the mind, body, and heart to be in sync with each other and work together at the same rhythm-beat. It creates a union of one pointed thinking, movement, and achievement.</p>
			<p>CRTC Yoga for Athletes offers both in season and off season training programs. The in season program is geared towards rejuvenation, minor strains & soreness recovery, increasing flexibility, game visualization, positive psychology, manifesting achievement, & blocking out negativity. The off season program helps to improve strength & endurance, muscle tone conditioning, increasing flexibility, and improving your overall athletic performance.</p>
