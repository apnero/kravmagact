				<p>This program is specifically related to sports training and is broken down into both the physical and mental side of athletics.</p>
				<br>
				<a href="#" id="example2" class="btn btn-danger" rel="popover" data-content="Physically this program works on combining the athletes inner and outer strength and flexibility. The organs, muscles, ligaments, & nerves become energized, purified, toned, & strengthened.  The circulation of blood, oxygen and lymph is also improved.  On a mental level one develops an awareness of the inner innate intelligence orchestrating the body into each pose. You will begin to see what we normally call intelligence is just a small part of a larger intelligence at work. When one does yoga they enter a mind-set of feeling good; it is out of this good feeling place-space-vortex that one is able to create more good things like visualizing making a putt or completing a crucial pass. When we fall into a negative mind set we lose focus and struggle to overcome our negative way of thinking. Yoga helps the mind, body, and heart to be in sync with each other and work together at the same rhythm-beat. It creates a union of one pointed thinking, movement, and achievement.  CRTC Yoga for Athletes offers both in season and off season training programs. The in season program is geared towards rejuvenation, minor strains & soreness recovery, increasing flexibility, game visualization, positive psychology, manifesting achievement, & blocking out negativity. The off season program helps to improve strength & endurance, muscle tone conditioning, increasing flexibility, and improving your overall athletic performance." data-original-title="Yoga for Athletes">Read More</a>

				<p>The Strike-Fit program was developed specifically for young teenagers between the ages of 12 and 14.</p>
				<br>
				<a href="#" id="example4" class="btn btn-danger" rel="popover" data-content="At this age, your teen is beginning to explore the real world and is meeting life's unexpected obstacles along the way.  At this age, we find our kids experiencing a life that we as adults did not witness until much later while growing up. Bullying, the increase in violent street crimes, and teenage obesity are major problems today. The Strike-Fit program focuses on these issues. This unique program stresses personal safety, sportsmanship, teamwork, and physical fitness while pushing your teen to partake in something they have never done before. With an emphasis on safety in training, teens are challenged physically and mentally in every class.  This never-seen-before program not only educates your children in security and safety but also helps with your busy schedule as a parent. This program starts after school, and parents do not have to worry about transportation to the studio. Students in the Newtown school district have the option to take the bus to Cannon Ridge Training Center, where our instructors meet your child curbside and escort them directly into the facility for class. This program is broken up into two parts, one being the self-defense training, and the other is a classroom session where students get a jumpstart on their schoolwork in a supervised environment while they wait for your arrival at pickup. The aims of the classes are to equip students with the skills needed to avoid and deal with threats and attacks, recognize a problem before it happens, improve their ability to respond quickly, learn how to resolve problems and get the physical exercise each child needs." data-original-title="Strike-Fit">Read More</a>
