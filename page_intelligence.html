        <div class="span6">
			<p>The following distance learning courses are offered by Cannon Ridge Training Center in partnership with the S2 Safety & Intelligence Institute. These courses are specifically geared for the busy working professional who doesn't have the time to travel or the time to sit in a classroom all day. For budget-conscious organizations, our online courses also offer a cost-effective way to train personnel without incurring travel expenses or lost productivity due to training time.</p> 
			<p>All of our distance learning courses are presented through the S2 Online Academy's virtual classroom system. While other online training systems limit the learning experience to reading course material and listening to audio lectures, the S2 virtual classroom system uses Macromedia Flash-driven slides and streaming video of mastered instructor presentations to provide a dynamic learning environment unequaled by anything short of a live classroom.</p>
