			<p>Krav Maga is Hebrew for "Contact Combat". This system uses practical applications which can be easily acquired regardless of size and strength and teaches each student not only to protect themselves against an attacker but to help them physically and mentally prepare for the unexpected. This style of training does not require a uniform; we train in casual gym clothes and sneakers. We do our best to replicate real-life scenarios and environments. Our training comes directly from Israel and we teach Krav Maga in the fighting system's most modern evolution. Krav Maga has been tested and proven to be the most effective defense system on the planet. Classes are conducted in a safe and comfortable environment for all fitness and skill levels.</p>

		<h4>Public Safety Strength & Fight Conditioning</h4>
        <div class="span10">
			<p>This program is specifically designed for public safety and is exclusive to law enforcement, military, fire, security, and corrections personnel. This program is a 60-minute intensive training session that incorporates the strategies of Israeli Krav Maga and is designed to maximize individual performance by combining strength exercises with fight and defense conditioning drills. This program works in conjunction with the specific defense and restraint movements already utilized by public safety personnel. The Public Safety Strength and Fight Conditioning program is designed to prepare public safety personnel to prevail against any type of violent street confrontation or eventuality. Defensive tactics include defending against an assailant wielding an edged weapon, impact weapon, firearm and multiple-opponent attacks. This provides public safety personnel with practical application defense tactics while improving one’s overall strength, hand-eye coordination, and situational performance readiness. This program consists of 25 minutes of full body strength circuit training in our strength conditioning area followed by 35 minutes of Israeli Krav Maga. Public Safety Strength and Fight Conditioning is offered on Monday and Thursday evenings at 5:30 p.m.</p>

		<h4>iKrav Teen Street Smart</h4>
        <div class="span10">
			<p>The iKrav Teen Street Smart program was developed specifically for young teenagers between the ages of 12 and 14. At this age, your teen is beginning to explore the real world and is meeting life's unexpected obstacles along the way. At this age, we find our kids experiencing a life that we as adults did not witness until much later while growing up. Bullying, the increase in violent street crimes, and teenage obesity are major problems today. The iKrav Teen Street Smart program focuses on these issues. This unique program stresses personal safety, sportsmanship, teamwork, and physical fitness while pushing your teen to partake in something they have never done before. With an emphasis on safety in training, teens are challenged physically and mentally in every class.
This never-seen-before program not only educates your children in security and safety but also helps with your busy schedule as a parent. This program starts after school, and parents do not have to worry about transportation to the studio. Students in the Newtown school district have the option to take the bus to Cannon Ridge Training Center, where our instructors meet your child curbside and escort them directly into the facility for class. This program is broken up into two parts, one being the self-defense training, and the other is a classroom session where students get a jumpstart on their schoolwork in a supervised environment while they wait for your arrival at pickup.
The aims of the classes are to equip students with the skills needed to avoid and deal with threats and attacks, recognize a problem before it happens, improve their ability to respond quickly, learn how to resolve problems and get the physical exercise each child needs.</p>

		<h4>Private & Semi-Private Instruction</h4>
        <div class="span10">
			<p>Private instruction is a great way to get individual attention to help you meet your goals and take your training to the next level. Private instruction is offered seven days a week and is a great way to improve your skills. These sessions are scheduled around the student's availability. These private lessons can be taught at one of our current locations, or in the privacy of your own home or office. Private instruction is charged by the hour. Discounts for private sessions are available if purchased in packages of 10 in advance.
In addition to one-on-one private sessions, we do also offer semi-private instruction, which involves two or more students and is a great option for families and/or organizations who wish to train their employees.
For more information on private, semi-private, and small group instruction, please e-mail or call today.</p>
